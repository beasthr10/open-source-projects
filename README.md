# OpenSource Projects @ Scaler 
Scaler Academy Open Source Projects Hub 

## About 

The **Scaler Open Source Projects Hub** is a place for the Scaler community, alumni of Scaler Academy and members of the InterviewBit tech team to come together and collaborate and big and small open source projects. 
Many people within InterviewBit and Scaler communities are long time contributors of the vibrant open source software ecosystem, and we feel a community built around computer science and software engineering should have a space to collaborate together and idea both useful and fun. 
The OS Projects Hub is open for anyone and everyone to come and be a part of and collaborate together on. Read on further in this page to know more about the projects and how to participate.
